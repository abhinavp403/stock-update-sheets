# stock-update-sheets

Created a python script which updates my stock watchlist daily on google sheets. Finnhub API retrieves essential information such as open, close, low, high values and puts them in a tabular form in google sheets. Project is uploaded on Google Console which creates a json file to be shared on your sheets as 'edit' to help connect your code to Sheets. Takes about a minute to update data for 20 stocks.

Libraries used-
1) Finnhub API
2) Google Sheets API
3) Google Drive API
